## Flash Filesystem Features

Key features of this Flash Filesystem for the P2 Edge Flash chip:

- Wear-leveling write mechanism
- Writes are stuctured to facilitate recovery  of file structure after unplanned power failure
- Block identification is independent of a blocks physical location
- Filenames are 127 characters plus zero terminator
- Seeks supported
- File Append supported
- Circular file writes supported 
- **Coming Soon** Can be accessed from all cogs (first cog to call mount() mounts the filesystem for all cogs to use.)
- **Coming soon** *Directory Support* 

## Adding the Flash FS to your own project

This section describes how to quickly get the flash filesystem working in your project.

### Download the latest flash_fs.spin2 file

Every time you wish to start a project using the flash filesystem you will want to download the latest version from the repository [ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS). In the list of files on the top page you will see the file `flash_fs.spin2`. You can download this single file to get the latest or you can navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS/releases) page where you can download the latest release which includes demo files as well as the filesystem object.

### Include the Flash FS object in your top file

Place the downloaded `flash_fs.spin2` in your project and in your top-level object include the flash object:

```spin2
OBJ { Objects Used by this Object }

    flash  : "flash_fs"	           ' the Flash Filesystem
```

The driver keeps about ~4250 bytes per open file. The space is allocated for two open files by default.  You can override this in your top-level file by changing the include to something like:

```spin2
OBJ { Objects Used by this Object }

    flash  : "flash_fs"	 | MAX_FILES_OPEN = 4       ' the Flash Filesystem
```

In this case we are telling the compiler to allocate room for 4 simultaneously accessable files instead of the default two files.

### Format() or Mount() the flash filesystem

At the start of your application will need to mount() the filesystem.  

```spin2
PRI main() | status

    status := flash.mount()	           ' start up the FLASH filesystem
    if status <> flash.SUCCESS
      '... you know that some blocks were corrupted and freed ...
```

If you know that that the flash chip in your P2 Edge module has never been formatted then you can call format instead of mount. (The format will then do the mount for you.)

```spin2
PRI main()

    flash.format()	           ' start up the FLASH filesystem
```


### work with files on flash as you would normally

Now that your filesystem is mounted you are free to do normal file operations. The filesystem API is very similar to the ANSI-C file handling API so this all should feel pretty natural to you.

Review the [Flash F/S Object I/F Documentation](flash_fs.txt) then start reading and writing files!

Please Enjoy!

## Credits

Thank you to **Chip Gracey** for the excellent **Flash File System 16MB** written for the P2 which is the core of this fileysystem.

Thank you to **Jon McPhalen** for helping to specify the customer facing API for this filesystem and for guidance in our future directions for the upcoming dual filesystem driver as well.  Jon also contributed his interactive filesystem demo.

Thank you also to members of the [forum thread - "On-Board Flash File System"](https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/175470/on-board-flash-file-system#latest) for also contributing ideas and guidance for implementation of this driver.
