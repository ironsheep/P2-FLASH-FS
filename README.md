## Credits

Thank you to **Chip Gracy** for the excellent **FLash File System 16MB** written for the P2 which is the core of this fileysystem.

Thank you to **Jon McPhalen** for helping to specify the customer facing API for this filesystem and for guidance in our future directions for the upcoming dual filesystem driver as well.

Thank you also to members of the [forum thread - "On-Board Flash File System"](https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/175470/on-board-flash-file-system#latest) for also contributing ideas and guidance for implementation of this driver.
