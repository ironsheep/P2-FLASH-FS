   File....... flash_fs.spin2
   Purpose.... This object is the full flash file system driver for the P2
               it manages all but the first 512KB of the flash chip (where the boot image is stored)
               it provides a standard (ANSI C like) file system interface to the flash chip
   Author..... Chip Gracey
   Conrtributions..... Jon McPhalen, Stephen M Moraco

   Started.... AUG 2023
   Updated.... 20 DEC 2023
 =================================================================================================
 v1.2.0 - initial release of flash_fs with full API
 v1.2.1 - revised seek() method parameters - can now seek relative to current position in file
 v1.3.0 - update for flexspin compatibility, seek() returns file position, write() returns bytes written
 v1.3.1 - more update for flexspin compatibility, adjusted seek(), read() and write() add file_size_for_handle()
 v1.4.0 - Adjustments allowing multi-cog support
 v2.0.0 - Add read/modify/write, non-destructive mount check, create_file()
